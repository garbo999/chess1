<h1>p4wn, a smallish javascript chess engine</h1>

      <div id="chessboard-2" style="margin: 20px; float:right"></div>

<p>
P4wn is a small public domain chess engine. It was first released in
2002, and substantially revised in 2012.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
Click on the piece you want to move, then click where you want it to be.
</p>

<p>
If the game is too easy or hard, click on the <b>computer level</b>
button until it seems about right.
</p>

<p>When you make a stupid move, you can undo it by clicking on the
<b>undo</b> button.</p>

<p>Further instructions can be found in the <a
href="https://github.com/douglasbagnall/p4wn/blob/master/README.rst">README</a>
file.
</p>

<h2 style="clear: both">News</h2>

<h3>2012-08-12: P4wn 2.01 released</h3>
<p>
Version 2 had user interface problems in Microsoft Explorer. Thanks to
Uwe Alex for the bug report.
</p>

<h3>2012-07-03: P4wn 2 released</h3>
<p>
Version 2 has been released, following the apparent cessation of
activity. Read the <a href="announcement-v2.txt">announcement</a> if
you wish, and look out for version 3 in 2022.
</p>

<p>
Zip and tar files can be found at <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/p4wn/files/">Sourceforge</a>.
</p>

<h3>2012-03-22: P4wn 2 also on Github</h3>
<p>
At <a href="https://github.com/douglasbagnall/p4wn">https://github.com/douglasbagnall/p4wn</a>.
The clarified code is currently known as “<a href="announcement-almost-v2.txt">almost version 2</a>”.
</p>

<h3>2012-03-19: Switch to Git, with clarified code</h3>
<p>
All of a sudden I decided to pay some attention to this. The <a
href="http://p4wn.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=p4wn/p4wn;a=summary">git
repository</a> obsoletes the CVS, and the code has had some attention
to make it explicable.
</p>

<h3>2005-03-23: Sven Vahar's fancy version in CVS</h3>
<p>
The <a href="http://aab.pri.ee/chess/">improved board</a> that
<a href="http://aab.pri.ee/">Sven Vahar</a> made in December 2004 is now
available in CVS, and as a zip <a href="downloads/sven_vehars_fancy_version.zip">download</a>.
</p>

<h3>2005-03-04: Unicode version by Antony Lesuisse</h3>
<p>
Antony Lesuisse replaced the external gifs with unicode glyphs, creating a
<a href="unicode/">completely self-contained page</a> of only 4385 bytes.  It has been added to CVS.
</p>
<p>
If you don't see a row of chess pieces here (&#9812;&#9813;&#9814;&#9815;&#9821;&#9822;&#9823;),
you might have problems using the page - it depends on your browser's font rendering.
</p>
<h3>2004-12-14: New version by Sven Vahar</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://aab.pri.ee/">Sven Vahar</a> has created a cleaner
interface with help text, with both
<a href="http://aab.pri.ee/male/">Estonian</a> and
<a href="http://aab.pri.ee/chess/">English</a> versions.

</p>

<h3>2004-03-25: Sourceforge site registered</h3>
<p>This is what you are looking at.</p>

<h3>2002-06-16: First released in 5k web competition</h3>
<p>Development started in 2000 and skipped 2001.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
It recursively explores the tree of possible moves, keeping score along the way.
It tries to take as many pieces as possible and get into the centre early.  That's
about all.   Its endgame strategy is to win before the endgame.
</p>

<h2>Mailing list</h2> <p>There is a <a
href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/p4wn-chess">mailing
list</a> hosted by sourceforge, which averages about two messages per
year. Ask any questions there.

It seems much stronger than p4wn, and uses the WebWorkers javascript
to keep the UI going while it schemes away in the background.

Óscar Toledo G. has written various tiny chess engines in various
languages, including <a
href="http://nanochess.org/chess4.html">javascript</a>. Óscar
Toledo is the undisputed world champion of chess minification and
obfuscation. His code manages to somehow be humorous at the same time
as being unreadably compact. It plays quite well, too.

Neil Pearce wrote a javascript chess game which no longer seems to be online.

There was one by David Moore in the 2001 5k
competition.  Now it is

The most famous small chess implentation is probably the <a
href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~uzdm0006/scans/1kchess/assem.html">1k
ZX81</a> game.  Not only is it short, it ran in only 1024 bytes of ram
(javascript has megabytes to play with).
On the other hand, it didn't know all the rules.
